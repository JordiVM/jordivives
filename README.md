# JordiViv.es

This is indeed a blog about me and what I do, only this is the source code. It will be much easier to take a look at if you open the website version at [jordiviv.es](jordiviv.es). Changes are automatically updated when I push changes to the repository.

The website is currently hosted on Cloud Run in GCP (more information in the blog). It uses Jekyll and is based on beautiful [portfolYOU](https://github.com/yousinix/portfolYOU) Jekyll theme.
