# **About Me**

I am Jordi, a Software Embedded Engineer with strong background in electrical design from my Electrical Engineering studies. Turns out that I enjoy technology in any form, from ASIC to systems. The only problem is that time is limited and one can only dedicate time to learn so many things.

This blog aims to contain my struggles and evolution along different fields. Improve professionally is the main objective of this blog, but I feel all this project wouldn't be complete with daily life struggles. I don't want to narrow down the content to technology only. So I say it here, first and foremost, this is the blog of my struggle with life. Meaning you can expect anything I feel like trying out.

If you want to know a bit more about what I have already done, scroll down. For what I am and what It is to come, just take a look to this blog, I hope you have a good time.
